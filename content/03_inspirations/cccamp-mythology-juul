"Some time ago, the extraordinary space ship heart of gold was on its way through milky way ... The ship needed repair and the crew looked out for help in the neighbourhood. they established communication with a couple of hackers on planet earth who offered assistance in fixing the ship's infrastructure. the crew agreed on a three-day reconstruction trip to that funky looking blue planet. on august 6th, 1999 the space ship enter earth orbit and the crew will land on planet earth near berlin, germany. debugging will start immediately.

"First contact with the crew of the Heart Of Gold has been established around five years ago. ... Since then four years have passed and the Heart Of Gold has announced it's return to the blue planet. The crew wants to share knowledge about its recent expedition to planet Marplon 4 where they discovered a yet unknown substance called Fairy Dust. The substance is emitted by a robotic plant and is reportedly a yet unknown species of nanorobotic organism. The substance autonomously intrudes all kinds of electronic devices causing unexpected but welcome self-repairing effects."

"The truth is that fairydust is a secret Soviet weapon very few people know about. It seems to be a substance from outer space, emitted by robotic plants on an unknown planet. ... Fairydust, the Russians soon found out, has a peculiar effect: Everyone who comes into contact with fairydust becomes anti-authoritarian. Ungovernable. Unusable for whatever regime in power. [the fairydust] dissolved in ... a freshwater reservoir for West-Berlin ... after a few months, the anti-authoritarien effects of the dust began to appear! On June 2, 1967, students in West-Berlin started demonstrations against an official visit by the Shah of Persia. ... The rest is history and usually called the German student movement."

"In the beginning, the Universe was created. This was widely seen as a step of limited sustainability in its current implementation and thus, space hackers on board of the spaceship Heart of Gold began with the creation of a parallel universe, the hacker space. Four years after the Big Bang in the hacker space movement, this parallel universe was mostly completed. Using a semipermable membrane to link the two universes (which were now known as the “dual core”), hack-value was transfered to the parallel universe. The precious fluid substance that formed the hack-value was called “the Flow”. With the steady influx of Flow, the hacker space universe began to prosper and adopted the name “Fluid State”. Henceforth, the old universe was known as the “Solid State”. But a simple coexistence of Solid and Fluid State proved to be difficult and the old saying was heard being murmured again: “Who controls the Flow controls the Metaverse”...

Deprived of the Flow, the Solid State universe soon began to show signs of erosion and mechanical wear. Turbulences occurred that could be traced back to the growing instabilities; suddenly, everything happened at once. Thousands of diplomatic SubEtha calls were leaked by an unknown entity. Several desert planets saw revolutions and insurgencies. At this point, the powers that be in Solid State decided that they couldn't take it any longer. They called for an all-out attack on the hacker space parallel universe.

In a sinister plot dubbed “Project Osmosis”, the Flow was to be re-transfered and sucked from the Fluid State, destroying everything of hack-value. This is the menace we're currently faced with. The space hackers once again turn to their old allies in the Milky Way. The Heart of Gold will return to Earth. Your cooperation and help is needed."

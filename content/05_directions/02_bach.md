## Bay Area Consortium of Hackerspaces (BACH)

When we are unable to do things alone that we can only do together, or when we realize the potential of collaboration over division, we may form structures to support our mutual benefit. [BACH](http://ba.chgrp.org/) was inspired by both the observable growth of creative communities and hacker spaces in the Bay Area, as well as examples observed from other places in the world.

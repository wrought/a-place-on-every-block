## Preface

This summer I missed a flight. The next connection left from New York the following morning, so I accepted the first leg and arrived in Newark airport some hours later with a day to kill. I grabbed a tram to a train to the subway and popped up in the Upper East side to stay with some cousins. At street-level, with my bags, and the humid warmth, I let myself drift a bit. The visual lines, the proximity, the people. I examined stoops, peeked in shop windows, thought a lot about urban configurations. I noticed the trees lining the sidewalk in this neighborhood had little fences around their plots. When I saw a container of plastic bags at eye-level height with a sign about dog poop, I realized the purpose of these micro-parks. How clever, I thought, and this is a sort of creativity that is conscious of the city's density. My interest was piqued. What other sorts of optimizations and "hacks" are there? What can I observe? 

When I made it to my cousin's place, I ran in to a man painting in the hallway outside the elevator. Another gentleman, older with a beard, stopped at our floor but was continuing down with the lift to the garage in the basement. This painter jumped to help him carry some items, and I heard on the gentleman's return the painter had taken the recycling for him all the way across the garage. The gentleman was visiting family in the building, as was I. Later, I learned from my cousins the painter was the building's superintendant, the "super." His role in the building was to take on up-keep tasks, and for him, to be helpful and curteous to his fellow tenants.
I thought about this for a bit. We don't exactly have the same culture in California. There are property managers and such, but I had not had any experience with someone quite like a "super," since most of the work was coordinated by these managers rather than done by them. Handypersons, for instance, in my experience would usually live some place else and be hired per-job or on an on-going basis.

Then it hit me. 

Each of these buildings, these big, close-laced buildings&mdash;how many are there? Maybe a few, or up to 10 per block? The city is full of these supers. And with a super, there is always a place to store objects, small and large, including equipment and materials. I assumed, maybe not always, but some times there must be actual workshops, with tools and a bench available for fixing and making the necessary items for the building. 

What if just one, out of every ten on every block, was made a little more open? Sure, folks could sign up, maybe agree to use the tools and replace ones they break, etc. But what if it was relatively easy to use this workshop for projects, hacks, art, and all the things I've come to see take place in hackerspaces in the US and around the world?

A place, where folks can go to express their creativity and share with one another, on every block in the city.

That would be a wonderful place to live.

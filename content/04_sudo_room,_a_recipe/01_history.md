Matt Senate was at Science Hack Day 2011 in San Francisco. His friend Jacob Shiach, visiting from Texas, was researching funds for alternative communities practicing open science and citizen science.

On the following Monday, Jacob and Matt set up the [sudoroom.org.](http://sudoroom.org) website and reached out to local online communities. Via the DIY Bio email list, Jacob found Marc Juul who met with Matt in the east bay. They discussed their interests and general directions. The three set out doing research, making contacts, and establishing a weekly meetup. The first official, open meetup was held at [Caffe Mediterraneum](http://caffemed.com/) in Berkeley. 

They held a few more meetups at "The Med". After a few weeks, the group convened at Radio, a bar in downtown Oakland. They were invited to a Winter Holiday party at Tech Liminal, a technology salon and co-working space run by Anca Mosoiu. After some conversation, Anca offered to host thesudo room meetup to coincide with a weekly Wednesday hack night.

Jacob's in-person involvement was brief, but he continued to support the project online, working with Matt in particular for many months as folks in the bay first got the meetup off the ground. He followed along on the email list, updated a collaborative document with links, and offered moral support. At the same time, his own project, [BrightWork CoResearch](http://brightworkcoresearch.com/) began to unfold.

The name "sudo room" is based on the Linux `sudo` command, which means "super user do." `sudo` allows the user to act as the super user, or `root` account. There is a running joke online that `sudo` has real-world applications beyond the shell, as [XKCD demonstrates](http://xkcd.com/149/). Sudo room's name stuck as a literal interpretation: an attempt to run the "room" command as the super user&mdash;a command to create the room itself. However, it was originally formed as a remix on the name of [Hacker Room](http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Hacker_Room) a co-working and community space in Mexico City. I spoke with one of the co-founders about how they started; I was very curious about how to get such places off the ground. He said he found a few folks who were interested in making it happen, they began to pool some money together, and finally started looking at listings for offices in their price range. Simple as that, just find the space and start paying.

Ultimately, Jenny Ryan inspired an alternative interpretation that felt profound: in sudo room, everyone who walks in is a `sudoer` or *super user*, they have root access, and they are permitted to *do*. It reminded me of [some mythology surrounding Plato's Academy](http://plato-dialogues.org/faq/faq009.htm), which claims that inscribed above the entrance was, "Let no one ignorant of geometry enter." Instead of qualification, we turned this on its head&mdash;there are no qualifications beyond your own creativity and imagination, in fact, you get `root` to the space when you enter.

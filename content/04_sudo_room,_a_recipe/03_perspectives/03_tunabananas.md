# Jenny's Story - From Jaded Academic to Culture Hacker
> We know who we are. We are the dispossessed, the outcasts, and the outsiders, rebels with a cause who have upturned the mulch of our dead lives and seeded those fertile fields with incendiary visions of our future selves. Having already subverted the norm, we renunciate dominator culture’s status quo of everything and drift happy disconnected - babes in the abyss - wavering in the ambiguity fog of dislocation. Free-floating between old worlds and the new, guided only by the shining paths of mother evolution. We have passed over, we have passed the point of no-return and since there is no turning back, we celebrate the momentum lifting us on the wings of perception, grace, and whatever skills we have earned from surviving the inevitable catastrophe of self. Only when we are over, does our real life begin.

**March, 2011**

It was a monotonously pleasant day in San Diego. Fittingly, I had recently moved in to a shared house in Paradise Hills, well east and south of the university campus in La Jolla. From my overly-large room on the second floor, I could see the distant lights of Tijuana. Downstairs, the television was blaring as my unambitious housemates sat in front of the couch, eating fast food in a haze of marijuana smoke. 

It was the fifth place I'd attempted to call home since moving to the city in the fall of 2009 for a Ph.D program, the natural progression for an anthropologist with an anticapitalist bent. This most recent move was something of a reaction formation, an attempt at peace and normalcy following a disorienting 9-month stint in an intentional community occupied by an eccentric bunch of old New Agers and an abusive partner. Driven by a desire to immerse myself in the Californian hippie culture that had shaped most everything I considered sacred, I'd been instantly smitten with the rich history of the house. Two of the residents were hoarders, an anthropologist's dream. I'd spent hours digging through the 40-year-old New Age catalogues and magazines, rebellious pamphlets, notes and letters written in a time when the revolution seemed nigh, even inevitable.

Unfortunately, the reality of communal living - in particular the hardset neuroses of those who'd been questing for community and wholeness their entire lives - hit hard. Pulled into house meetings that lasted well into the night, I became their willing scribe. What were at first rather good ethnographic field notes became painful testimonials of sad, angry, traumatized and unstable relations between the housemates. Most retreated into their respective shells, occasionally lashing out in the form of bitter notes, angry outbursts, even destruction of parts of the property. Moving into the large upstairs room with my partner at the time, we incubated the energy of the house and lashed out at each other. Things grew more and more violent, until one day it became unbearable - I'd had to hide in the closet and bar the door to keep safe. Unable to focus and overly-immersed in the emotional instability around me, I floundered in my teaching and research, and finally got the hell out.

Yet the depression and mild PTSD persisted. I was spending long hours on the Internet, chatting late into the night with faraway friends, many of whom I'd never met AFK (away from keyboard). One friend, a superconnector sort I'd met once at a MAPS ([Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies](http://maps.org)) conference. Relaying my desperate state, he provided a tempting out: "Come up to the Bay Area and camp with me and a group of BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) hackers." In that moment, an excitement rose up in me, not unlike the fervor with which I'd dove into Burning Man and then into a houseful of New Agers. It was the natural next step in my exploration of the cultural components that shaped the birth of cyberspace: hackers. *Obviously*.

## Coming home to the San Francisco Bay Area
> "Institutions learn from studies; communities learn from stories."
> 																				— John McKnight
 
Grateful in my nomaddery to possess a car, I drove northward, stopping briefly overnight in Los Angeles to gather Scott and Erin. The further away I drove from San Diego, the less I considered it escape - rather, I felt at last the sense of moving toward, forward motion. The journey up the coast was a blur, what sticks in memory only that drive over the Bay Bridge: the dinosaur-machines of bayside Oakland giving way to the strange oasis of Treasure Island, the rainbow effervescence of San Francisco finally coming into view, sandwiched by the shimmering blue waters of the bay. 

We landed in SOMA at a warehouse I would come to know well - 360space. Airy and artsy, with traces of DIY craftsmanship in every corner, I fell instantly in love. I first met Jehan, a wiry guy with a mess of reddish hair and a contemplative, inquisitive aura, and then Rikke, who struck me instantly as a leader, with her strong handshake and broad, welcoming grin. Azi, she informed me, was out back, fixing the car. I started rolling a smoke to take with me outside, the first since our last rest stop on the highway, and Rikke rubbed her chin, eying me with ebullience: "Ooh! Can I roll one too? Or just share it with you?"

I rolled my smoke and handed her the pouch, and we chatted amiably as we wound our way to the parking lot out back. I stopped short when I saw them, and burst out laughing: Scott and Azi were both intensely focused behind the hood of a car that had clearly seen better days, Scott scooping out greasy water with a large ladle while Azi inspected the engine up close. They were both speaking in low tones with each other, and I walked further behind them and out into the bright sunlight. Scott, ever the people person, finished what he was saying and turned to me with a flourish. "Azi! Meet Jenny, she's amazing!" Azi straightened as if commanded, turned and met me while swinging his long blond hair from his face with a modest grin - an idiosyncracy that would come to be exceedingly familiar, in time. Azi suggested that we remove the batteries from our phones, and we did, as he explained the futility of private communications when all phones were bugged at the hardware level. I'd learned my very first lesson from hackers.

Before long we were following Azi, Rikke and Jehan over the Golden Gate Bridge and up into the winding roads along the coast. Azi drove fast, but expertly, while I took the turns with caution, unfamiliar with the terrain. In a few hours' time we'd made our way to our destination: a scenic camping ground at the base of Point Reyes. Setting up camp, I marveled at the efficiency of my campmates, their preparedness and awareness of their surroundings. Indeed, I was intimidated, and walked a ways to orient my headspace, writing in my notebook. As the sun set we made a campfire. Rikke, gathering wood, muttered something in a language instantly familiar to me. "Are you Danish?" I asked her, in Danish. She looked up, startled yet clearly pleased, and we proceeded to share our affinity with Denmark. She was here to stay, having married Azi some months prior. I had been an exchange student in Denmark when I was 17. She'd never met an American who spoke Danish, and I'd never met a Dane quite like her: strong, assertive, and self-reliant to the core.

As we joined the others at the campfire with our newfound bond, I felt the flow of serendipity course through my veins, revitalizing me. We smoked weed and got real, sharing our visions. Rikke spoke of the anarchist collectives she'd lived in for years back in Denmark, and her vision to create a hacker village founded on the right to create. Azi spoke of military family upbringing and his years as a software engineer with the same burnt-out sensibility I shared through my relationship to academia. Then, his eyes brightened as he began rhapsodizing about a utopian future in which we all lived in beautiful self-made treehouses, visiting our neighbors by way of personal wind-powered aircrafts. Jehan, ever the inquisitive one, was asking me what I'd been working on for my Ph.D. 

[Quote from Azi or Rikke]

"My field is cyberanthropology," I started, smiling a little at the familiar spark of interest that comes with asserting a hip-sounding neologism. "I research a culture by immersing myself in it, trying to understand the world from the perspective of the other, and then attempt to translate that perspective to a wider audience through storytelling and historical analysis. I'm particularly interested in the confluence of psychedelic culture, ecovillages and intentional communities, and open source technologists."

"That's fantastic!" Rikke cried, leaning forward. "An anthropologist is exactly what we need, a scribe to document the revolution!" I laughed, loving the confidence I felt in her, that she herself, her very being, *was* the revolution, and she intended to conduct it into scaling. We talked late into the night, as the fire dwindled into a smoldering pit, and easily decided it would be far warmer, and more fun, to sleep doggy-pile in Azi and Rikke's larger tent. 

The next morning, I awoke sandwiched between Scott in fetal position at my back and Jehan, his feet dangerously close to my face. Erin was curled on the other side of Jehan, with Azi and Rikke on the other side of his feet, all lanky limbs entwined. We all woke slowly, enjoying the feeling of collective intimacy, 'til Rikke announced, "Time for breakfast! Coffee and a spliff!" 'I think I'm in love,' I thought.

Stoned too early for my preferences, however, I grew paranoid. It all seemed far too idyllic, everyone vibing with my dreams, dreaming the same dream, it would seem. We were about to hike to the summit of Point Reyes, and it felt to me I was being drawn into a rite of passage. My new friends seemed to be as enamored with me as I was with them, yet my trust and self-confidence had suffered a serious blow over the course of the past year. 

We continued to talk non-stop as we walked slowly up the steep cliffs. Rikke, a biologist by training, stopped often to crouch down and peer at the alien vegetation, identifying plants with the analytical brain of a scientist. When we reached the summit, she loped off to explore the cliffside, Azi looking after her worriedly, watching her every move. We spoke of ideas, ways of connecting places, people and projects aligned with our vision of a better world. Hacker homesteads. A web platform for documenting the revolution. A dating site for geeks, in which projects reign over pulchritude. Breathing in the sweet air of the windy peak and gazing over the ocean, I felt, at last, that I'd found my people - those crazy enough to make the future in the vision of the deeply desired, and to share it all for free, without possessiveness.

The feeling of love-at-first-sight persisted with every human I was introduced to upon our return. Intending to nap before driving Scott to the airport that morning, I found myself engaged in conversation across the kitchen table with a seemingly-unending array of fascinating humans. It was around 5am when Alex, a tall, lanky guy in a long black trenchcoat and dark, somewhat alien features, rolled in and captivated my attention with his vision of a code-your-own-game *a la* The Diamond Age. Needless to say, I at that point gave up on the notion of a nap. 

The next morning, nestled in a blanketed nook in the common space, I woke bleary-eyed to a beaming Rikke handing me a cup of coffee. "Rise and shine, beautiful! Here's your coffee." I'd been up half the night thinking, knowing I was about to take a monumental step in my life journey. The steaming coffee, perfectly sweetened, and Rikke's bright blue eyes, kind and intelligent, swooned me instantly. 

"Can I stay here for a little while?" I asked, somewhat hesitant. Rikke assuaged my apprehension instantly:

"Of course you can, darlin'! Welcome home."

## Learning Freedom and Discovering Noisebridge
> Form communes.

> Communes come into being when people find each other, get on with each other, and decide on a common path. The commune is perhaps what gets decided at the very moment when we would normally part ways. It’s the joy of an encounter that survives its expected end. It’s what makes us say “we,” and makes that an event. What’s strange isn’t that people who are attuned to each other form communes, but that they remain separated. Why shouldn’t communes proliferate everywhere? In every factory, every street, every village, every school. At long last, the reign of the base committees! Communes that accept being what they are, where they are. And if possible, a multiplicity of communes that will displace the institutions of society: family, school, union, sports club, etc. Communes that aren’t afraid, beyond their specifically political activities, to organize themselves for the material and moral survival of each of their members and of all those around them who remain adrift. Communes that would not define themselves – as collectives tend to do – by what’s inside and what’s outside them, but by the density of the ties at their core. Not by their membership, but by the spirit that animates them.

I'd taken a Leave of Absence from my program that day, and proceeded to spend the following week soaking up the energy of the brilliant artists and hackers who composed the demographics of 360space. Azi, Rikke, Jehan and I conversed late into the night, energized by coffee and the epically beautiful spliffs Rikke rolled with precision, long filters and carefully-proportioned herb and tobacco. I recorded our brainstorms and took special note of the phrase, 'free as in freedom, not as in beer.' We came up with plans, meticulously organizing ourselves, feeling empowered by the process and our mutual adoration of each other.

Pulling myself from the reverie of our two-week-long brainstorm, I paid a visit to a friend with whom I'd been chatting, and flirting with, online for months. Evan's apartment instantly felt  like home - psychedelic art and literature in every corner, gorgeous exotic plants and dream herbs greening the small space, long conversations peppered with YouTube clips and a continuous soundtrack of tastefully-curated electronic music. And the snuggles, like two long-lost kittens who found in each other a perfect peace. I felt my heart beginning to suture itself back together in his presence. I stayed, moved some things there, introduced Evan to my new friends. We all got along smashingly.

Sometime in that first month of meeting them, Azi and Rikke took me to Noisebridge, a hackerspace in the Mission District of San Francisco. The moment I stepped foot in the space, narrowly missing a wheelchair-turned-robot on a rampage, I was hooked. Weird art covering the walls, soldering irons and circuitboards scattered across the large tables, someone at a sewing machine in the back, the sound of a drill press in the woodshop toward the back, some machines I'd never seen before... 

"That's a 3D printer, a Makerbot." I looked up to find a grinning, welcoming young man extending his hand. "I'm Rayc - is this your first time at Noisebridge?" I shook his hand, smiled and nodded, glancing back at the Makerbot with curiosity. 

"Would you like a tour?" he asked. Too good to be true! Rayc guided me around the space, pointing out the different zones and greeting the geeks and freaks scattered about the space working on various projects, reading books or tapping furiously at laptops. The classroom was full of people - "Intro to web development class," Rayc explained, "free, like all our classes here!" A group of folks were gathered in the kitchen, where Rikke had headed immediately, running late to her biohackers meetup for bottling the kombucha she'd been cultivating over the past few weeks. 

I asked Rayc how everything was run, how it worked, and what the rules and social norms were. "We have only one rule!" Rayc laughed, clearly enjoying his role as guide, "Be excellent to one another. Noisebridge is a do-ocracy, so if you see something that needs doing - just do it! Don't ask for permission unless you think you might be stepping on someone else's toes." A sign above the library, in bold black paint, read "Shut Up and Hack". I grinned, thanking Rayc for his tour and moving toward the kitchen, to ask Rikke if she might show me how to cap the kombucha she was circulating into sterilized beer bottles. I'd found yet another home, this one a cross between a free school and a tinkerer's wonderland.

Come May, I submitted my talk for that year's *American Anthropological Association* conference, joining a panel of anthropologists exploring post-humanism and digital anthropology. 

> **Re-Imagining the ‘Global Village’ in an Age of Networked Materiality: Designing Online Spaces for Group Coordination, Participation, and Collaboration**

> What does a genius software developer alienated from his military-industrial roots, a dynamic Danish plant biologist and radical DIY enthusiast, a savvy ex-construction worker turned star web entrepreneur, and a jaded graduate student cyberanthropologist with a penchant for networking and poetic expression have in common? An open source / free culture / DIY ethos and a commitment to empowering people, projects, and communities with the tools and resources to construct alternative economic systems and form resilient communities from the ground up, with the shared understanding that building the decentralized web requires a flattening of hierarchies, a bridging of previously-separated social and cultural spheres, and the imaginative building of worlds that would repair the deep sickness of industralization.

> Self-organizing knowledge-based communities are abundant on the web, ranging from the obsessive Wikipedians of Wikipedia, to the elite maker culture of Linux users, to the underground hacktivists of Anonymous. True to the spirit of the engaged "doactivist" principles of San Francisco hacker/maker culture, I have at the time of this writing temporarily dropped out of my graduate program to co-create the Pyre, a three-tiered, open source, secure web platform rooted in the grassroots projects I’ve been collaborating on over the past year. The result is to be a kind of “posthuman ethnographic mashup” that incorporates multimedia archives and community documents, the social organization of networked space, web-based communication tools and collaborative projects alongside the stories and shared experiences of individual members. In this sense, the end "product" is as collaborative, dynamic and diverse as its subject.

## A Series of Excellent Failures: Adeline Live/Labs, Banq Design and #OccupySF 

Brainstorms grew more complicated to conduct in-person as I settled in at Evan's apartment in Oakland, commuting regularly across the bridge to meet up with the others at 360space. In order to properly carry off our project, we knew we had to find a space to live together. As per our now-traditional grandiosity, we put together a proposal with a couple of other Noisebridgers to create a live/work hackerspace in the East Bay. We'd found the perfect building, owned by a man with kind eyes and a deep love of Linux who was even willing to put up the funds to get the building up to code.

> **Project Description:**

> Maker culture and recession-era entrepreneurship are on the rise, and the San Francisco Bay Area is overflowing with creative start-ups, technological innovation and green grassroots initiatives!

> The neoCreativist Live/Labs is the proposed future home for a free technology and urban permaculture DIY-lifestyle collective composed of makers, technologists, and educators from Noisebridge, a 501(c)(3) educational non-profit. As a part of Noisebridge, Live/Labs seeks to facilitate innovation and entrepreneurship through community/neighbourhood initiatives to share open source technologies and tool chains. Current plans and available resources include a fully-equipped fabrication lab for 3-D printing; a membership-sponsored free technology hackerspace / community resource center for talks, classes and collaborative projects; and a DIYBio lab and rooftop food forest for explorations into home-based ecosystem balance, urban agriculture, and the general cultivation of biophilia.

> The primary contributions of the collective to the East Bay community will be providing material resources, work space, and hands-on classes and workshops for individual and collective projects. We are interested in collaborating as closely as possible with both city officials and neighbourhood groups, and aim to align ourselves closely with the development plan for West Oakland.  

It was a grand proposal, yet we had the momentum of doactivist hackers dedicated to the tasks ahead. One day in midsummer, the rug was pulled from under us: the landlord, who was going through a sticky divorce, received a 'Stop Payment' on all building expenditures. We had no money, no jobs, nothing more than a shared dream and the willingness to work for it. Deeply disappointed, we knew we needed to find a way to support ourselves immediately. Jehan and I started a business, which we called Banq Design, in an effort to make some money creating websites for people. Uncomfortable with making deals and asking for money, I absorbed myself in learning the basics: I bought a Virtual Private Server, installed Ubuntu on it, and followed Linode's excellent documentation to set up Apache, PHP, MySQL and Wordpress. Jehan designed the frontend, and I maintained the backend, showing our clients how to edit content themselves and easily honoring their requests for particular features by curating the best of the thousands of free and open source plugins created by the open source Wordpress community. We began in late summer and made a few hundred dollars a month, just barely enough to live on.

Azi and Rikke moved into a house just down the street from our failed Live/Labs and owned by the same landlord, rapidly installing an automated watering system and planting a garden that would come to bloom with tomatoes, herbs, cucumbers and more. Evan and I moved into a spacious apartment just five blocks away, and we all met frequently, scrapping together meals and brainstorming plans to achieve our future of abundance, freedom and community. Over the coming months, Rikke's penchant for housing downtrodden humans put an added strain on our little family. While food was easy enough to find, the lack of space and income flow made day-to-day living stressful. Come fall, the addition of a new housemate, a Danish biotechnologist named Marc who was helpful, resourceful, and gainfully employed, added much-needed sanity to the chaotic household. 

I took another Leave of Absence from my program, unwilling to return to San Diego when I knew I had much more to do here in the Bay. By late October in 2011, the Occupy movement had reached a fever pitch across the U.S. I'd been going to the camp down on Market St in San Francisco, enjoyed the convivial energy and the free association / mutual aid ethos of my fellow revolutionaries. Yet, I was uncomfortable with the prospect of sleeping in the camp and wanting to find a way to tangibly contribute. An email off the Noisebridge listserv, forwarded to me from Marc, invited folks to a hackathon to rework the OccupySF website. I'd met Rachel via Rikke and Noisebridge, and and we together collaborated on the proposal for Adeline Live/Labs. She had a small business and had written much of the paperwork for Noisebridge's beginning stages. 

[Paragraph and/or quote from working on occupysf site]

Marc came home one night in mid-November and said simply, "I met with a guy today who wants to start a hackerspace in Oakland." I looked up from my laptop where I'd been attempting to figure out an inexplicable server load on the OccupySF site and rubbed my eyes. 

"Fuck yeah! When's the next meeting?" 

## Hacking the Commons: Sudo Room
> A human being is part of the whole— called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature.
> — Albert Einstein

Some weeks later, Marc and I met up with Matt and a few other folks at Caffe Mediterraneum, a Berkeley staple which claimed the fame of birthing the latte. Among them was Michael, a soft-spoken and articulate anthropologist researching the DIY Bio movement. Matt, an energetic young Berkeley grad, was describing his vision for a 'sudo room' hackerspace in the East Bay. I introduced myself and shared my too-recent failure at creating a live/work hackerspace. 

I think we were all drawn to the idea of creating something from scratch. There was an existing hackerspace in Berkeley/Emeryville, Ace Monster Toys. AMT continues to be a hacker's paradise, replete with expensive, quality tools and an active calendar of classes and workshops - including a 'Hacker Scouts' program for cultivating kids' making. Nevertheless, it was some distance from the BART (public muni) and several miles biking uphill from downtown Oakland. We had the shared vision of co-creating a seed, a publicly accessible space valuing civic engagement and citizen science, that might serve as a model for spaces to come. Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V! 

We continued meeting weekly, discovering and articulating our shared values, learning about each other's projects and brainstorming future collaborative hacks. From the beginning, we committed ourselves to the active practice of openness, transparency and collaboration. Drawing from prior experience as well as the Hackerspace Design Patterns guide, we set up a mailing list, wiki, and IRC channel. We take notes together using an etherpad shared document, and post them on the [wiki](https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Meeting_Minutes) after each meeting. We decided to run by consensus without fastening ourselves to a binding agreement; iteration is invaluable, and we wanted to leave room for growth and change. Around the same time we began to form a cohesive group, several other Bay Area hackerspaces were also forming - [Hackermoms](http://hackermoms.org) in Berkeley, [LOLspace](http://oaklandmakerspace.org) in East Oakland, and the AnarchaFeminist Hacker Hive out of Noisebridge.

In May, we had a kickstarter/fundraiser (calling it a 'kickraiser') featuring a panel of Bay Area hackerspace representatives, including [BioCurious](http://biocurious.org/) (a DIY biotech space in Sunnyvale), [HackerMoms](http://mothership.hackermoms.org/) (a hackerspace for moms in Berkeley) and [The Crucible](http://thecrucible.org/) (a fine and industrial arts education space in Oakland) as well as the aforementioned (Noisebridge, LOL and Ace Monster Toys). Participants spoke on the topic of “Hackerspaces: The Necessity for Community Spaces Here and Everywhere.”

<img src="http://www.shareable.net/sites/default/files/upload/inline/6646/images/hackerspacepanel%281%29.png">
*From left: Praveen Sinha (LOL), Jen-Mei Wu (LOL), David Rorex (Ace Monster Toys), Lisha Sterling (Hacker Moms), Joseph Jackson (Biocurious), Steven Young (The Crucible), Michael Scroggins (sudo room) and Mitch Altman (Noisebridge; kneeling, far right) speaking on the topic of "Hackerspaces: The Necessity of Community Spaces Here and Everywhere" during sudo room's kickraiser on May 4, 2012.*

Come summer, we'd moved into a space – of sorts – an eclectic building also home to a psychic, an improv theater group, a nurse's training organization and a gun security instructor. We rented the box office and a tiny orange closet, giving us access to the large classroom space and two smaller back rooms. For better or worse, the improv theater folks hold auditions in the classroom every weekday evening. We have our meetings in the back room, but the open ceilings prevent any possibility of privacy – our voices often straining to be heard over the raucous hollering and silly sounds of the actors.

Despite the limitations of the space, we made the most of our momentum: We worked together to develop a [governance structure](https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Sudo_room/Governance_Structure), [get a bank account](https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Sudo_room/banking), and [forge a compact](https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Compact).

We also made the most of our location in uptown Oakland by hosting events for the monthly First Friday Art Murmur. For August's Art Murmur, we took the opportunity to stage a public announcement declaring our [Intent to Exist](http://sudoroom.org/declaration-of-intent-to-exist/) – a requisite for obtaining a bank account without a federal tax ID – followed by an attempt to see how many hackers we could fit in our small box office space (the answer? 42.).

There is something truly exciting about the interconnections between subcultures and the value of their hybridization in the spirit of creativity. What happens, for instance, when you combine botany buffs and hackers? You might get something like [BioBridge](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/BioBridge), the amorphous DIYbio contingent of Noisebridgers, working on experiments in oyster mushroom growing and developing [Arduino-controlled sensors](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/BioBoard) for monitoring temperature and pH levels in kombucha brews and sourdough starters. Here you would also find overlap with [Tastebridge](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Tastebridge)'s [Vegan Hackers night](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Vegan_Hacker_).

While Sudo Room embraces an inclusive model of “hacking” that goes beyond hardware and software - to wetware, wearables, and even culture itself – there is certainly reason to resist confining ourselves to hacker culture alone. While not disregarding the admirable ethical core of lifelong learning, decentralization, and collaboration, the term is also connotative of an elite culture consisting of a privileged class of internet savants.

Jen-Mei Wu, co-founder of Liberating Ourselves Locally, wrote the following in response to our invitation for Saturday:

> “I really liked the way you called the proposed federation a DIY federation and not a hackerspace federation. Often when I talk w/ hacktivists, I get the feeling they think everyone should hack, that hacking == DIY. But … there's this whole amazing universe of DIY groups that live outside (sometimes waaaay outside) hacktivist circles, and they are doing great things.

> I think hackerspaces really could learn a lot from each other, but that they could gain even more by being part of a larger community of DIY organizations.”

LOL, short for Liberating Ourselves Locally, is an Oakland maker space founded and run by people of color. The group works closely with other local grassroots organizations dedicated to fostering self-sufficiency and community-based commerce. Their events have ranged from weekly carpentry classes to yoga classes, meditation sessions, Decolonize study groups and political co-education (with pancakes!), demonstrating the wide swath of possibilities for creating an inclusive community education model.- See more at: http://www.shareable.net/blog/hacking-the-commons-how-to-start-a-hackerspace#sthash.a29rW264.dpuf

Sudo Room finally moved into its own space in the late fall of 2012, rapidly filling up its schedule with a swath of regular classes and meetups: Matt took on the early shifts, spearheading Morning Math and Morning Code, 4 times a week; we hosted members' art and held workshops during the monthly First Friday Art Murmur; weekly meetings took place on Wednesday evenings, as always; Workshop Weekend brought a bevy of folks to Sudo Room and other open tech spaces throughout Oakland; a weekend-long 'Sudo Convention' brought core members together to hack on our Articles of Association; and [Oakland Wiki](http://oaklandwiki.org), spearheaded by Marina, began meeting weekly on Thursdays. In December, we hosted a conference in the large common space attached to the Sudo room, calling it the [First Annual State of the Room](sudoroom.org/wiki/State_of_the_Room). We kickstarted the weekend with a housewarming party, featuring stations to demo and learn about our 3D printer, radio room and audio equipment, DIY cheese-making, and soldering/electronics. The next day, we held concurrent sessions on a range of topics:
* Intro: State of the Room address: Past, present, and future of sudo room
* Mission and vision of sudo room
* New membership / Onboarding - "How to be a Sudoer"
* Lessons in the Articles of Association
* Linux install help
* Update on the access/door hacking
* Helping people create profiles on the wiki
* Sudo suite: tools for for internal management
* Open source micro tractors
* Oakland Wiki
* Fiscal solvency - how to make money
* How to increase membership
* Free class: Programming: zero to making money
* Inclusiveness, diversity & access
* Craft of facilitation
* Ethics 101
* The power of names: online identity
* BACH (Bay Area Consortium of Hackerspaces [and other partnerships]) 

Over the course of 2013, I've dug deep into some new projects that remain steadfastly aligned with the original larger, if naive, vision that had driven me here to begin with:

* [The People's WiFi](http://sudorom.org/wiki/Mesh) is a project to build citizen-powered communication channels for sharing internet bandwidth through creating a point-to-point mesh network. However, mesh networks are awesome because they don't depend on the existing centralized Internet Service Providers to function. Though they can be connected to the Internet as we know it now, a mesh provides a decentralized means of communication with our local community. We view mesh networks as a means of reconnecting to our neighbors, supporting local businesses, and enabling grassroots community collaboration. In the event of disaster or government censorship, an active mesh network is a resilient means of communication and sharing of information. 

* Mycelia ([wiki](http://thepyre.org/wiki/Mycelia)) is a decentralized network of people, projects and objects in open, collaborative spaces. We intend to create a system that facilitates autodocumentation of available tools, similar projects and skilled people in “community laboratories” such as hackerspaces and intentional communities. Aggregating this data into a searchable database will facilitate collaboration between groups, improving transparency through community asset mapping of available resources across open spaces. Based on a layered map of conceptually proximal connections, the software is free and open source, allowing editors to fork it and add extensions, plugins, and layers. The nature of the network, like all decentralized platforms, requires all contributors to abide by certain norms of excellence in affecting the integrity of the project. 

* [The Open Oakland Digital Divide Group](http://oaklandwiki.org/Digital_Divide) is a collaborative effort to coordinate the various organizations and individuals working on digital divide issues in Oakland. Spawned out of a session at CityCamp Oakland last December, the group consists of local citizens, technologists, and community change workers interested in creating solutions for effectively addressing the digital divide in Oakland. At our first meeting, held on January 24th, we articulated a few tangible goals to work on: individually reaching out to preexisting groups addressing digital divide issues to assess their needs and available resources; group field trips, visiting for instance a local swap meet where broken computers are donated to a group that turns them into working machines; and creating a central directory of digital divide resources for the city, including for instance a map of local, free tech meetups.

A year and a half later, Sudo Room firmly established with a room of its own, [Counter Culture Labs](http://www.counterculturelabs.org/) spins out of the East Bay Biohackers branch of SR's network. Still looking for a space, the city property codes around zoning for biological research is a deciding factor in where they can be.

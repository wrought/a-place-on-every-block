## Journey-as-Recipe

Sudo room is a journey, with destinations both planned and unexpected. There are many of us, but the elements we share, our interesections and developments as individuals and collectively, form the sudo journey. In a hippie-beatnik-California view, it has always been about the journey, not the destinations.

A recipe, like all creative expressions, has the potential to inform action, but also for itself to change, to transform, to evolve. How many ways are there to cook a given dish? Surely the recipes are numerous, but even each batch is different. Sometimes these differences get logged, transcribed, translated, shared, reproduced, augmented and so on.

The previous chapter introduced valuable examples, inspirations, and antecedents to our view of the hackerspace movement, including our role in it. The chapters that follow are an attempt to take the sudo room journey, including narratives based on the lived experience of those involved, and generate a recipe to be prepared and remixed by who ever may find it useful.
